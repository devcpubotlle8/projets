        <h2>The Mystory of Mamo</h2>
        <p>
          Lupin, the master thief/spy/Jack of all Trades, has been executed,</br> but
          he is still alive, and not even Lupin himself knows how that is
          possible. While trying to figure out, however, he and his gang are</br>
          thrust into a conspiracy involving clones, Lupin's un-trustworthy
          rival Fujiko, and a minature mad-madman's plot to take over the world.
